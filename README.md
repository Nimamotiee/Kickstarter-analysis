##Module 1 Assessment performing analyis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

###Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project was to provide Louise with a detailed analyis of different campaigns and how they fared in relation to launch dates and their funding goals. We created two analyis surrounding 1) Outcomes Based on Launch Data and 2) Outcomes Based on Goals to further assist Louise in her decision making procees on whether or not she should pursue further funding for her play "Fever".
###Analysis and Challenges:
####Analysis
We began our analysis by looking at the data for all theater projects for all years given the data to determine and provide a visual explanation of Successful/Failed/Canceled theater projects. See Visual representation (docs/Theather_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
Finally, we ended our analysis by looking at Goals for all items in the subcat "Plays". We performed this by accumulating all Successful/Failed/Canceled data for plays and staggering that data by amounts per goal from Less than $1000 up to Greater than $50,000 and providing a visual representation of that data here (docs/Outcomes_Vs_Goals.png)
####Challenges
We did not face any challenges during this analysis although this was due to the data being presented in a clear and accurate manner. If the data was corrupted or segregated in an inaccurate manner then presented the analysis would have taken much longer.
###Results:
####Outcome Discussion
Theater projects tend to be much more successful at obtaining their goal during the months of May and June. In addition, the majority of theater projects are attempted to kickstart during the summer months-perhaps because of the heat!
Goals that have an amount of $45,000 or greater has an extremely high chance (greater than 80%) of failing to meet the stated goal.
####Limitations and Further Analyis
The datasets limitations are not limited for the purposes of the above excercise but if we wanted to look at other metrics such as detail on specific backers then we could add more analysis for Louise to better fund her campaign.
We could further create a graph such as outcomes based on pledged to determine the greatest pledged projects and to determine the most successful type of funded project.
